                and help everybody to have a good experience. We learn together how to work as a team.</p>

                <p class="nacha-opinion">I was scared at the beginnning, because I never do rafting before. I came only for my best friend,
                but now I love rafting! The guides here were so kind and capable to be patient with persons like me and then teach me how to do
                rafting as a team</p>

                cry, but the guide was so kind with me. He teached me everything and he was next to me everytime! When the route finished
                he comes to me and he congratulates me because I acted with courage and he give to me a little pin that says "I Love Rafting".
