      <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Samuel Claros" width="200">
      <p>Hello! My name is Samuel Alejandro Claros Garcia and I'm from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I enjoy playing videogames and going on a ride on my bike.
        I love to play videogames, specifically I'm in love with Rocket League.
        At this moment, I'm studying in BYU-Idaho, it is weird because I never studied online but now
        I'm in my house everyday the whole day. It is difficult for me but I know the Lord can be the impossible possible, he reachs me out everyday and
        I trust in him. I'm serving in the church as a stake high council member and I'm working with YSA, I'm the youngest in the quorum and I don't know why but the Lord believes in me
        to make the stake bigger. I love to serve the Lord, he is my North and I always reach to him everyday.
        An advice: Trust in him ALWAYS.
      </p>
